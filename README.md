*Fast Food Mermory Game* is my second portfoilo project for college. I have built a memory game using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
 
# Scope of the project includes the features, the game app will have, like: A menu, Logo, Main image, score and footer. This game is for children of ages 4+ and above.
```The Users (kids) will see the home page with the main image, menu bar and footer. I tries to design a game which is interactive in design and wasy to navigate. The color scheme is consistant through the app. The menu bar the same on all pages in the app. The user can easily navigate around the app and predict -whats going to happen when he or she clicks on a link. The user can easily learn how to use the site at -first glance and what the user needs to do to play the game or return to the home page is claerly visible.``

 #### If the user can answer yes to these questions, i have acheived what i wanted to acheive.
1.  Where am i?
 2. How did i get here?
3. Where can i go from here?

```I believe this app can be used with -singal-trail learning.- The app is easy to use and the user can see where a link will take them.`` 

#### When designing the app, i drew some wireframes, so i could get a idea of what the app would look like.
#### I decided to go with a menu at the top and a main image with a footer, formthe home page. The image on the home page i made myself using canva. I wanted the game to be a grid, in the center of the page with a menu at the top and a footer at the bottom. The images for the cards are from Ania Kubow.``

#### The game is responsive and works on all screen sizes. I have tested the game on these devices:
1. IPHONE SE
2. IPHONE XR
3. IPHONE 12 PRO
4. PIXEL 5
5. SAMSUNG GALAXY S8+

10. SURFACE PRO

### This app works on desktop too. 

#### Ive tested the game by playing the game, getting other people to play the game too.
